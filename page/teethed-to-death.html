      <h3>Adventure Hooks</h3>
      <p>
        Donya will be your primary hook for this adventure.
        She will usually hit a soft spot for the players and also present a reward for finding Lon for additional persuasion.
        Checo will aslso act as a secondary if more money is needed to persuade all members of the party.
      </p>
      <h3>Lon' Lost Lover</h3>
      <p>
        The adventure begins in a comfortable inn.
        Some players may have been here for a couple day and others just wandered in for a breakfast ale.
        All Seems to be quiet in the tavern hall.
        <br><br>
        A thin women, <strong>Donya</strong>, enters the inn holding a small pouch close.
        She begins talking to <strong>Checo</strong> the innkeep quietly but quickly grows in volume.
        Donya abruptly breaks way towards the tavern and stand on a table one of the adventurers is sitting at.
        Haphhazardly she explains that her husband <strong>Lon</strong> went out looking for the recently missing <strong>Kobal</strong> but never returned.
        She <i>needs</i> someone to find him and offer a reward for anyone who finds him.
        The majority of the patrons solemnly turn back to their meals.
        <br><br>
        When an adventurer talks to her she'll step down from the table and say she's unsure where Lon went to look for Kobal, otherwise she would have gone herself.
        Donya will recommend to start with Kobal's father <strong>Oleg</strong> who lives to the south.
        <br><br>
        If no one talks to Donya then Checo will lead her to a seat in the corner and personally scope out some potential adventures that could do the job, and provide the previous information himself.
        He'll personally up the reward if pressed, feel free to work this number as needed.
        <br><br>
        Regardless of scenario, Checo will always step in until all players have accepted the quest.
        He will also offer directions to anyplace the adventurers seek.

          <h5>Roleplaying Donya</h5>
          <p>
            Donya is naturally a shy character whom is forced to be public in efforts of finding Lon.
            She has a tendency to stare at the nearest object in silence when alone.
            Her main motive is getting a group to find Lon.
            Subconciously she may interject that a group is necessary, for it will increase the chance of Lon being found.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Checo</h5>
          <p>
            Checo while softly spoken is always cheery and helpful to locals and adventurers.
            He is well respected by the locals but isn't prideful of it.
            He has a lot of leverage persuading locals to cooperate and will do so for the party.
            Appeasement is his primary motive and cares deeply for his community.
          </p>

      <h3>Housebound</h3>
      <p>
        Arriving at Oleg's house, he will answer the door looking tired, distressed, and weary of questioning.
        He is amicable to the plight of finding Lon whom he's known for years.
        When questioned of Kobal he'll reluctantly reveal that he returned last night but is sick.
        Oleg will allow the players to view Kobal.
        <br><br>
        Kobal will be in bed on his side facing away from everyone, clutching himself tightly.
        From afar, Players will notice that his fingernails are missing, bruised head-to-toe and is murmuring to himself (indistinguishable).
        <br><br>
        Oleg is aware these are signs of transitioning into Strigoi spawn but won't speak of it.
        If questioned about Kobal's whereabouts, he will disclose that Kobal kept repeating "the manor, the manor...", which Oleg recognizes as Croft Manor.
        <br><br>
        If the <b>party keeps 10 feet away from Kobal</b> they will avoid an altercation with kobal and may leave with the information regarding the manor.
        <br><br>
        If a <b>party member steps within 10 feet of Kobal</b>, a thirst for blood will take over and he will attack the nearest party member (see stat tables and behaviors below).
        <br><br>
        After the encounter if <b>Oleg is still conscious</b>, he will try to stabilize Kobal.
        Any attempts to attack an unconcious Kobal will cause Oleg to go for a butcher knife, <i>bottom left of the bedroom</i>, and attack the aggressor.
        <br><br>
        In the case that <b>Oleg is unconcious or dead</b>, a bloodied paper can be found on the bed (presumably kobal's) that detail directions to croft manor at nighttime.
        <br><br>
        (optional) you may hide an item in the house as a plot hook for the party if they search the house the other information.
