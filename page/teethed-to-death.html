        The party starts with Kobal's father Oleg who unexpectedly is with a sick Kobal at their home.

        Cassandra however possesses a powerful item of dark evocation which she uses during the encounter.
        Will the party ensue conflict with the Strigoi by killing Cassandra, or spare her life and learn of the brewing insurrection.
      </p>
      <h3>Adventure Hooks</h3>
      <p>
        Donya will be your primary hook for this adventure.
        She will usually hit a soft spot for the players and also present a reward for finding Lon for additional persuasion.
        Checo will aslso act as a secondary if more money is needed to persuade all members of the party.
      </p>
      <h3>Lon' Lost Lover</h3>
      <p>
        The adventure begins in a comfortable inn.
        Some players may have been here for a couple day and others just wandered in for a breakfast ale.
        All Seems to be quiet in the tavern hall.
        <br><br>
        A thin women, <strong>Donya</strong>, enters the inn holding a small pouch close.
        She begins talking to <strong>Checo</strong> the innkeep quietly but quickly grows in volume.
        Donya abruptly breaks way towards the tavern and stand on a table one of the adventurers is sitting at.
        Haphhazardly she explains that her husband <strong>Lon</strong> went out looking for the recently missing <strong>Kobal</strong> but never returned.
        She <i>needs</i> someone to find him and offer a reward for anyone who finds him.
        The majority of the patrons solemnly turn back to their meals.
        <br><br>
        When an adventurer talks to her she'll step down from the table and say she's unsure where Lon went to look for Kobal, otherwise she would have gone herself.
        Donya will recommend to start with Kobal's father <strong>Oleg</strong> who lives to the south.
        Inside the tightly clutched pouch is <span class="accent-bold" id="donya-loot"></span>, which she may disclose if pressed.
        <br><br>
        If no one talks to Donya then Checo will lead her to a seat in the corner and personally scope out some potential adventures that could do the job, and provide the previous information himself.
        He'll personally up the reward if pressed, feel free to work this number as needed.
        <br><br>
        Regardless of scenario, Checo will always step in until all players have accepted the quest.
        He will also offer directions to anyplace the adventurers seek.

          <h5>Roleplaying Donya</h5>
          <p>
            Donya is naturally a shy character whom is forced to be public in efforts of finding Lon.
            She has a tendency to stare at the nearest object in silence when alone.
            Her main motive is getting a group to find Lon.
            Subconciously she may interject that a group is necessary, for it will increase the chance of Lon being found.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Checo</h5>
          <p>
            Checo while softly spoken is always cheery and helpful to locals and adventurers.
            He is well respected by the locals but isn't prideful of it.
            He has a lot of leverage persuading locals to cooperate and will do so for the party.
            Appeasement is his primary motive and cares deeply for his community.
          </p>
        </div>

      <h3>Housebound</h3>
      <p>
        Arriving at Oleg's house, he will answer the door looking tired, distressed, and weary of questioning.
        He is amicable to the plight of finding Lon whom he's known for years.
        When questioned of Kobal he'll reluctantly reveal that he returned last night but is sick.
        Oleg will allow the players to view Kobal.
        <br><br>
        Kobal will be in bed on his side facing away from everyone, clutching himself tightly.
        From afar, Players will notice that his fingernails are missing, bruised head-to-toe and is murmuring to himself (indistinguishable).
        <br><br>
        Oleg is aware these are signs of transitioning into Strigoi spawn but won't speak of it.
        If questioned about Kobal's whereabouts, he will disclose that Kobal kept repeating "the manor, the manor...", which Oleg recognizes as Croft Manor.
        <br><br>
        If the <b>party keeps 10 feet away from Kobal</b> they will avoid an altercation with kobal and may leave with the information regarding the manor.
        <br><br>
        If a <b>party member steps within 10 feet of Kobal</b>, a thirst for blood will take over and he will attack the nearest party member (see stat tables and behaviors below).
        <br><br>
        After the encounter if <b>Oleg is still conscious</b>, he will try to stabilize Kobal.
        Any attempts to attack an unconcious Kobal will cause Oleg to go for a butcher knife, <i>bottom left of the bedroom</i>, and attack the aggressor.
        <br><br>
        In the case that <b>Oleg is unconcious or dead</b>, a bloodied paper can be found on the bed (presumably kobal's) that detail directions to croft manor at nighttime.
        <br><br>
        (optional) you may hide an item in the house as a plot hook for the party if they search the house the other information.

      <h3>Dark Manor</h3>
      <p>
        A 4-hour trek through the northern meadows and sparse forest will bring them to Croft manor.
        Abondened for several years after Croft disappeared, the structure has weakened and clearly items of worth were ransacked long ago.
        <br><br>
        The interior of the manor is considered <b>dim light</b>.
        Nothing of obvious value is left to take in the house except for.
        At <b>point A</b> you may place a item as a hook into your own campaign; my item will be a ledger written undercommon denoting trade deals in the Underdark.
        The stairs leading to the second floor have collapsed and give no access.
        In the middle of the house at <b>point E</b> is another collapse and are unable to bypass unless your party gets creative.
        As they move toward the rear of the building they'll begin to smell an odor.
        <b>Hector</b> sits in the rafters (<b>point D</b>) above in the long arching hall waiting.
        Depending on the party size, there may be additional servants, place them up in the rafters as well in the hallway.
        <b>Cassandra</b> is standing at the opening to the tower, <b>point C</b>.
        "You shouldn't be here, leave with your souls while you can" she'll say when players are in sight of her.
        If the party asks about Lon, Cassandra will reproach Hector for being careless and back into tower.
        Hector will attack and Cassandra will go for the <i>chest</i>.
        For Hector and any additional servants, use the <i>Strigoi Servant</i> stat block.
        <br><br>
        (<i>optional</i>) If the floor in the tower is broken, it will reveal an underground passage.

          <h3>Lon's Body</h3>
          <p>
            If they follow the smell, they'll find Lon's body thrown into the corner of the kitchen (center of the house).
            Wearing a distinct cloak that can be taken back to Donya, his body appears hollow and dull in color.
          </p>
          <h3>Broken Chest</h3>
          <p>
            In the small chest the party will find the Indica Egg.
            If they spare or stabilize Cassandra, she will cooperate with the party and follow them back to town, unwilling to leave the egg.
            If they search Cassandra they will find a pouch containing <span id="cassandra-loot"></span>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <h3>Indica Egg</h3>
          <h6><b>Artifact, Legendary</b></h6>
          <p>
            While touching the egg, each user once per day may spend an action to do one of the following:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a path 5x30 feet from the caster.
                The ground may go up or down by 5 feet.
                all creatures in the path must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) to not go prone or fall.
                If the ground is made of stone then the range is only 10 feet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a 5x5x15 foot pillar made of in front of the caster.
                If the ground is made of stone then the pillar is only 5 feet tall.
              </li>
            </ul>

      <h3>Ravnica's Revenge</h3>
      <p>
        Once back in town, the party may return the cload to Donya.
        She will be devestated but withdrawn unable to fully process reality.
        She will offer the pouch to the party, unable to take her eyes off the cloak. Inside the pouch is .
        <br><br>
        If <b>Cassandra is alive</b>, after speaking with Donya, guards will appear at news of a Strigoi in town.
        They will be on edge, hand on sword wanting to down her.
        At this point, Ravnica, Cassandra's sister, will storm in to grab Cassandra and they will both vanish.
        <br><br>
        If <b>Cassandra is dead</b>, Ravnica will appear atop the Inn.
        Town bells will alarm of Strigoi, a small band of guard will in a defensive position around the inn.
        When the party comes out Ravnica will bellow “My sister has been murdered by scum of the realm, prepare for your final days in gloom haven”.
        She will misty step to one of the guard and thrust her hand through his chest, killing the guard, then vanish.
