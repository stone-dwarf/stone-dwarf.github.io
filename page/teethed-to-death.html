          <h3>Strigoi Lore</h3>
          <p>
            Use this information as it seems fit, Vampires can be subbed in place of the Strigoi for this adventure.
            The information below is known by locals and rarely disclosed to foreigners.
            Theorized to be a cousin of vampires, these blood suckers possess raw speed and magic.
            It is known that the Strigoi are all former members of the local community and feed strictly on foreign travelers.
            <br><br>
            Much like vampires they cannot withstand sunlight, but are vulnerable to silver weapons.
            Many also believe in the use of holy water, running water, and their requirement to be invited into residence (these however are untrue).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-header six columns">
          <h3>Concealed Info</h3>
          <p>
            The Strigoi will only convert the locals upon their request, per Strigoi tradition.
            Those who become Strigoi are no different from their former selves, only through consistent regiment can they harness the Strigoi bloodline.
            A hierarchy of power exist among the Strigoi, currently lead by Zorana, her primary concern is maintaining order within their populace.
            In secret Kasimir, a dipomatic but deceitful character, has been brewing an insurrection to take Zorana's seat using the Indica Egg.
            Ravnica is Zorana's right-hand and a sister by the name of Cassandra, whom has led an easy life of luxury discovered Kasimir's plans.
            Cassandra, with her servants, took the egg and fled in hopes of avoiding an internal war.

      <h3 class="section-header">Adventure Hooks</h3>
      <p>
        Donya will be your primary hook for this adventure.
        She will usually hit a soft spot for the players and also present a reward for finding Lon for additional persuasion.
        Checo will aslso act as a secondary if more money is needed to persuade all members of the party.
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-header">Lon' Lost Lover</h3>
      <p>
        The adventure begins in a comfortable inn.
        Some players may have been here for a couple day and others just wandered in for a breakfast ale.
        All Seems to be quiet in the tavern hall.
        <br><br>
        A thin women, <strong>Donya</strong>, enters the inn holding a small pouch close.
        She begins talking to <strong>Checo</strong> the innkeep quietly but quickly grows in volume.
        Donya abruptly breaks way towards the tavern and stand on a table one of the adventurers is sitting at.
        Haphhazardly she explains that her husband <strong>Lon</strong> went out looking for the recently missing <strong>Kobal</strong> but never returned.
        She <i>needs</i> someone to find him and offer a reward for anyone who finds him.
        The majority of the patrons solemnly turn back to their meals.
        <br><br>
        When an adventurer talks to her she'll step down from the table and say she's unsure where Lon went to look for Kobal, otherwise she would have gone herself.
        Donya will recommend to start with Kobal's father <strong>Oleg</strong> who lives to the south.
        Inside the tightly clutched pouch is <span class="accent-bold" id="donya-loot"></span>, which she may disclose if pressed.
        <br><br>
        If no one talks to Donya then Checo will lead her to a seat in the corner and personally scope out some potential adventures that could do the job, and provide the previous information himself.
        He'll personally up the reward if pressed, feel free to work this number as needed.
        <br><br>
        Regardless of scenario, Checo will always step in until all players have accepted the quest.
        He will also offer directions to anyplace the adventurers seek.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="roleplaying section-header six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Donya</h5>
          <p>
            Donya is naturally a shy character whom is forced to be public in efforts of finding Lon.
            She has a tendency to stare at the nearest object in silence when alone.
            Her main motive is getting a group to find Lon.
            Subconciously she may interject that a group is necessary, for it will increase the chance of Lon being found.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="roleplaying section-header six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Checo</h5>
          <p>
            Checo while softly spoken is always cheery and helpful to locals and adventurers.
            He is well respected by the locals but isn't prideful of it.
            He has a lot of leverage persuading locals to cooperate and will do so for the party.
            Appeasement is his primary motive and cares deeply for his community.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 class="section-header">Housebound</h3>
      <p>
        Arriving at Oleg's house, he will answer the door looking tired, distressed, and weary of questioning.
        He is amicable to the plight of finding Lon whom he's known for years.
        When questioned of Kobal he'll reluctantly reveal that he returned last night but is sick.
        Oleg will allow the players to view Kobal.
        <br><br>
        Kobal will be in bed on his side facing away from everyone, clutching himself tightly.
        From afar, Players will notice that his fingernails are missing, bruised head-to-toe and is murmuring to himself (indistinguishable).
        <br><br>
        Oleg is aware these are signs of transitioning into Strigoi spawn but won't speak of it.
        If questioned about Kobal's whereabouts, he will disclose that Kobal kept repeating "the manor, the manor...", which Oleg recognizes as Croft Manor.
        <br><br>
        If the <b>party keeps 10 feet away from Kobal</b> they will avoid an altercation with kobal and may leave with the information regarding the manor.
        <br><br>
        If a <b>party member steps within 10 feet of Kobal</b>, a thirst for blood will take over and he will attack the nearest party member (see stat tables and behaviors below).
        <br><br>
        After the encounter if <b>Oleg is still conscious</b>, he will try to stabilize Kobal.
        Any attempts to attack an unconcious Kobal will cause Oleg to go for a butcher knife, <i>bottom left of the bedroom</i>, and attack the aggressor.
        <br><br>
        In the case that <b>Oleg is unconcious or dead</b>, a bloodied paper can be found on the bed (presumably kobal's) that detail directions to croft manor at nighttime.
        <br><br>
        (optional) you may hide an item in the house as a plot hook for the party if they search the house the other information.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="roleplaying section-header six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Oleg</h5>
          <p>
            Oleg is naturally a reserved character whom seldomly shares information under his own volition.
            He will insist that the party keeps quiet since his son is resting.
            His primary motive is protecting his son.
            Since he knows Kobal is transitioning, he's worried of an altercation.
            Secondary motive is getting the party to leave without incident.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="roleplaying section-header six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Kobal</h5>
          <p>
            Not much is needed for Kobal, since he is turned away from the party.
            His thirst for blood overrides any ability to passively communicate even if restrained or contained.
            Only after <i>feeding</i> will he be able to speak with semblance of his former self.
          </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Dark Manor</h3>
      <p>
        A 4-hour trek through the northern meadows and sparse forest will bring them to Croft manor.
        Abondened for several years after Croft disappeared, the structure has weakened and clearly items of worth were ransacked long ago.
        <br><br>
        The main entrance faces west and windows are abundant throughout the structure.
        Two collapses have occured, at the stairwell and another in the center, denoted by rubble.
        These are impassable and force the party to move in a spiral-clockwise motion, obviously your party may subvert this with their creativity.
        The interior of the manor is considered <b>dim light</b>.
        Nothing of obvious value is left to take in the house.
        At any point you may place an item as a hook into your own campaign.
        <br><br>
        As the party enters the long arching hallway (top-right), they'll begin to smell an odor.
        <b>Hector</b> and any additional servants are hiding in the rafters above the arching hallway.
        Once a party member reaches the middle of the hallway, <b>Cassandra</b> will step into view from the tower (bottom-right).
        "You shouldn't be here, leave with your souls while you can" she'll initially speak, this is genuine.
        If the party asks about Lon, Cassandra will reproach Hector, he'll drop from the rafters casually and exclaim he thought the man, Lon, was a foreigner.
        <br><br>
        Cassandra will offer up Lon's body to the party if they leave.
        If the party agrees, Hector will fetch Lon's body from the kitchen (see below for info on Lon's body).
        Any member that begins to approach Cassandra or the tower will trigger the encounter.
        <br><br>
        (<i>optional</i>) If the floor in the tower is broken by the Indica Egg, it will reveal an underground passage.
        Place anything you would like below!
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="roleplaying section-header six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Hector</h5>
          <p>
            Hector is an arrogant narcissist.
            While he serves Cassandra without falter, he abuses the freedom he his given.
            He feels no remorse for jeopardizing the current situation.
            Primary motive is serving and protecting Cassandra, secondary is following his own whims.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="roleplaying section-header six columns">
          <h5>Roleplaying Cassandra</h5>
          <p>
            Currently on the run with the Indica Egg, she fears everyone is after it.
            Never having truly experienced the world, she feels out of her depth traveling alone with just her servants.
            Primary motive is keeping herself safe from Kasimir and his compatriots, secondary is guarding the Indica Egg.
          </p>

          <h3>Lon's Body</h3>
          <p>
            If they follow the smell, they'll find Lon's body thrown into the corner of the kitchen (center of the house).
            Wearing a distinct cloak that can be taken back to Donya, his body appears hollow and dull in color.
          </p>
          <h3>Broken Chest</h3>
          <p>
            In the small chest Cassandra carried, the party will find the Indica Egg.
            If they spare or stabilize Cassandra, she will cooperate with the party and attempt to follow them back to town, unwilling to leave the egg.
            If they search Cassandra they will find a pouch containing <span class="accent-bold" id="cassandra-loot"></span>.
            <br><br>
            Cassandra stole the egg from a powerful Strigoi, Kasimir, whom is currently brewing an insurrection.
            Somewhat lost of what to do with the egg, she knew the it would be safer if out of reach from him.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-header item six columns">
          <h3>Indica Egg</h3>
          <h6><b>Artifact, Legendary</b></h6>
          <p>
            While touching the egg, each user once per day may spend an action to do one of the following:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a path 5x30 feet from the caster.
                The ground may go up or down by 5 feet.
                all creatures in the path must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 12).
                On a success, the creature will move to an adjacent square at no cost.
                On fail, the creature falls prone.
                If the ground is made of stone then the range is only 10 feet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a 5x5x15 foot pillar made of in front of the caster.
                If the ground is made of stone then the pillar is only 5 feet tall.
                The saving throw applies to the pillar as well.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 class="section-header">Ravnica's Revenge</h3>
      <p>
        Once back in town, the party may return the cloak to Donya.
        She will be devestated but withdrawn unable to fully process reality.
        She will offer the pouch to the party, unable to take her eyes off the cloak.
        <br><br>
        If <b>Cassandra is alive</b>, after speaking with Donya, guards will appear at news of a Strigoi in town.
        They will be on edge, hand on sword wanting to down her.
        At this point, <b>Ravnica</b>, Cassandra's sister, will storm in to grab Cassandra and they will both vanish.
        <br><br>
        If <b>Cassandra is dead</b>, Ravnica will appear atop the Inn.
        Town bells will alarm of Strigoi, a small band of guard will in a defensive position around the inn.
        When the party comes out Ravnica will bellow “My sister has been murdered by scum of the realm, prepare for your final days...”.
        She will misty step to one of the guard and thrust her hand through his chest, killing the guard, then vanish.
        <br><br>
        In both cases, Ravnica is unaware that the Indica Egg was taken by Cassandra and makes no attempt to recover it.
